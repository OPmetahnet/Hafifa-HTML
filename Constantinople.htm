<h1>The Fall Of Constantinople</h1>
</head>
<body>

<div class="myDiv">
	<p><i>The fall of Constantinople</i> was the capture of the Byzantine Empire's capital by the Ottoman Empire.</p>
	<p>The city fell on 29 May 1453, the culmination of a 53-day siege which had begun on 6 April 1453.</p>
</div>

<p>The attacking Ottoman army, which significantly outnumbered Constantinople's defenders, was commanded by the 21-year-old <b>Sultan Mehmed II</b> (later called "the Conqueror"), while the Byzantine army was led by <b>Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos</b>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Fall of Constantinople marked the end of the Byzantine Empire, and effectively the end of the Roman Empire, a state which dated back to 27 BC and lasted nearly 1,500 years. The capture of Constantinople, a city which marked the divide between Europe and Asia Minor, also allowed the Ottomans to more effectively invade mainland Europe, eventually leading to Ottoman control of much of the Balkan peninsula.</li>
	<li>The conquest of Constantinople and the fall of the Byzantine Empire was a key event of the Late Middle Ages and is sometimes considered the end of the Medieval period.</li>
	<li>Since ancient times, cities and castles had depended upon ramparts and walls to repel invaders. However, Constantinople's substantial fortifications were overcome with the use of gunpowder, specifically in the form of large cannons and bombards.</li>
